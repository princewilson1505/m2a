<p>
    By enclosing words in the tags 
    <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> we can make 
    characters appear italic.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> element also represents 
    a section of text that would be 
    said in a different way from 
    surrounding content â€” such as 
    technical terms, names of ships, 
    foreign words, thoughts, or other 
    terms that would usually be 
    italicized.
