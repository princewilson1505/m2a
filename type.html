Commenting your Code
<p>
It is a very good habit to enter comment in your code. Entering comment in code helps you to keep track of the area and later you can easily debug them (if required). The browser ignores comments in HTML. In HTML we enter comments with in following tags:
<code>&lt;</code>!-- and -<code>&gt;</code>. For example the following comment reminds you that here you have inserted a Flash file.
<code class="text-success">&lt;</code>!-- Insert Flash file here. --<code>&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
    Same case is with PHP. Thru parsing engine, comments are ignored. In PHP we write comments in the following format: <p class="text-muted">// Your PHP comment goes here</p>
</p>
    
<p>/*This begins a C-style comments that runs on to two lines */</p>

PHP has Two Types of Comments
1. Single Line Comment - begins with a double slash (//) Example: <?php // this is a single line comment ?>
2. Multi line comment - begin with /* and ends with */
Example: <?php
/* This is a multi-line Comment */
?>
Variable Declaration
A variable is a means of storing a value, such as text string "Hello Student!" or the integer value 4. A variable can then be reused throughout your code, instead of having to type out the actual value over and over again.
